# 🌟 seabornXstreamlit-visualizer

An interactive data visualization app built with **Seaborn** and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
This project showcases insightful patterns in restaurant tipping behavior using the classic `tips` dataset.

> 📌 Developed as part of a professional bootcamp under the guidance of *Kodigit*, this project demonstrates practical data visualization and dashboarding skills expected in real-world data roles.

## 🔍 About the Project

This project explores various visualizations on the `tips` dataset using **Seaborn** and displays them interactively using **Streamlit**. It allows users to analyze how tip amounts relate to factors like:

- Total bill amount
- Time of day (Lunch/Dinner)
- Day of week
- Gender
- Smoking status
- Party size

It is structured to reflect **real-time industry standards**, including:
- Modular and documented code
- Interactive UI with plot selection
- Clear and consistent chart titles, labels, and themes
- Deployment-ready setup with `requirements.txt`
